Hello! This is Sibi Vishtan, after Learning in the development environment there was data science which was totally of analytics and which can be used totally in finance sector too. So I started learning more about market analysis and crypto markets, using data analysis and studying the market is always intresting and fun for me to learn.

I'm currently final year undergrad from [KLN College of Engineering](https://klnce.edu) majoring in Computer science and engineering with aggregate of 85.0% from (2018-2022). I have done several projects using java and python and this is my first time I've used ReactJs. And Planning to start a new carrer from data science and Artificial intelligence.

Here is a list of the technologies that I have learnt!
